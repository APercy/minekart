Minetest 5.2 mod: MineKart
========================================

This is the "MineKart", a mod that provides a little race car. 
It can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the seat with the dye.

like explaned at checkpoints mod:
Your kart starts with no fuel. If you are not in a race or your car was reseted by the black white flag, you can put biofuel on it. You need to attach himself to the car with the right button and punch the car with the biofuel gallon. Ok. But when you are in a race, you can only refuel at a refuel zone, marked by the fuel pistol icon. This zones have a radius of 5 blocks. To refuel you need stop, turn the engine off and punch the gallon against the kart. So you turn engine running again and go to the victory... or not!
